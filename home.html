        <h2>First of all thanks for coming this far. Before playing the game, let's understand the base of the story game and what is the aim of this game. You will have great time in learning the most precious element of our Earth that is Water. </h2>
    
        <p>
            In a small village, a young boy named VanPass Droplet is facing a challenge. His parents, hardworking farmers, spend all day and night in the fields, leaving VanPass feeling lonely and sad. 
            One day, while sitting in his classroom, VanPass discovers an interesting chapter in his geography book that talks about groundwater conservation. 
            This chapter ignites a spark within him, and he begins to see a way to not only change his life but also help his family and the entire village.
        </p>
        <p>
            Join VanPass on his journey to learn about groundwater conservation and how he can use this knowledge to bring about real change. 
            Each level will teach you important lessons about preserving this vital resource, and you'll face challenges that test your ability to apply what you've learned in both the game and the real world.
